I've also been looking at applying to grad schools for a PhD program, and the main thing that I've been worried about is recommendation letters.\n\nI know one professor somewhat well (took two classes with her, one of which was a project class where I presented to her) and I think she would be willing to write a rec letter. However, she's fairly well known in her field and I don't know if that makes it harder to get a rec from her.\n\nBut, most of the colleges I'm looking at for grad school need three letters. I've had good grades throughout my undergrad, mostly 3.9 and 4.0s. Because I was fairly comfortable with my classes, I rarely went to office hours. As a result, I don't think any of the professors who've taught me know anything about me other than that I was in their class and that I did well.\n\nI'm totally unsure now about how to proceed. Is it normal for professors to be asked for rec letters by students they only maybe recognize? Do they usually say yes or no?

{"texts": ["Graduating this year and not sure what type of grad school to pursue?", "How did you all decide that graduate school, and specifically the field you're studying in graduate school, was the right choice?\nI'm a senior at an excellent university studying Bioengineering. I think I'm a pretty odd case, as my passions have always been reading and creative writing, but I chose to study a flexible hard science as it would provide at least a little more use for the degree, and bioengineering was the most broad. As a result, though, I've always been open to a lot of career paths and have had a lot of trouble figuring out what I want to do. Going into my last year I've done really well in classes (3.95+ GPA), but I never found the subject to be something I was super passionate about: I was more just decently interested. My GPA, in combination with my research experience and volunteer work, has made me at least a viable candidate for law schools, med schools, and Bioengineering graduate programs (probably just a masters), and these three choices are quite different and career-defining.\nMy rationale for considering these programs and not just heading into the work-force is that going to top programs for any of these (especially law and med school) would allow me to rise significantly higher professionally and perhaps find more fulfilling work. A masters in bioengineering would allow me to specialize in the field (the BE field itself has options in which to specialize) more which would definitely improve my job prospects as well. Just thinking about deciding between all of this is seriously anxiety-inducing, and has always been for me since I entered college. They all seem somewhat appealing, and they all come with the con of &quot;What if I made the wrong choice and would have been better in that other field?&quot; While I know you can always switch afterwards or do multiple, practically and financially speaking that's far from ideal.\nGiven all this information, I ask you academics, who in my experience are some of the most focused, committed, and driven people in the world, how did you decide on what you wanted to do and make that commitment?"], "tags": ["career-path"]}
